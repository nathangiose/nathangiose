I am a hard-working, goal-driven leader that makes the best out of every moment. I always work towards getting the best results. I am empathic by nature so I always do things in a way that everyone will be happy. I have pronounced troubleshooting skills. My communication and interaction with peers, managers, and supervisors are excellent- when the need arises. I have always been interested in modernizing and creating content on computers.

Skills: JS / HTML / CSS / PYTHON / VBScript / VB.NET / SASS

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this page.
